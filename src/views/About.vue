      <h2>A little about myself</h2>
      <p><strong>Hi, I'm Helen.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>I'm a self-taught artist</strong> and also a front-end website developer, so with that very particular hyphenated set of skills it seemed like I should probably write my own website. I've been drawing and painting since I was old enough to find a thing that made a mark on another thing (I imagine my parents were thrilled).</p>
      <p><strong>When I got older</strong> (and needed the money) I cut my teeth in the art world doing pet portraits, and developed a super-detailed style of graphite portraiture that was borderline obsessive. I then began offering coloured and watercolour pencil portraits, which are a little bit more exciting and 10x harder to get right, but many years later I'm getting there.</p>
      <p><strong>The sculpture</strong> started while I was a temp in an office job and kept nicking blu-tack off everyone's desks to keep my hands busy. Turns out it's super hard to use it as intended when it looks like a cute bird. My leaving present was a card with a big photo of me drinking beer through a novelty horse mask, and an industrial quantity of blu-tack. I miss those guys, but maybe it's a good job I work from home now.</p>
      <p><strong>My main sculpture medium</strong> is now pottery; considerably more expensive than blu-tac to work with, if you factor in the kiln and glazes, so it's a good job I'm now considerably more responsible. I spent 6ish years attending a local pottery craft school called Clayability before I took a leap into setting up my studio at home in a shed. As well as creating odd little creatures, I love combining practical everyday items with small animals. If you have to use a mug every day, why not use a cute one with a little cat hanging out on it? Life is nothing without a little whimsy.</p>
      <p><strong>When it comes to web development</strong> I earned my living working in tech doing front-end dev and design for mostly Laravel based PHP web apps, with my little company Hatch Apps Ltd. Hatch became a full product called Xavier Analytics and we rode the startup rollercoaster for a few years before we were acquired in 2020 by Dext, and the rest is corporate history. I then left my job at Dext in 2024 to go back to creative arts for a little while, it's essential for the soul.</p>
      <p><strong>I love</strong> pretending I can care for plants that are hard to kill, using too much teal in everything, weird science stuff (I have an MSc in Neuroscience, not that I've ever used it - now it's just a creepy hobby I guess), and of course all manner of animals, beasties, birds and beings. In my very limited spare time while I'm not drowning in impostor syndrome, I can be found playing my playstation and drinking tea with my cat, Griffin.</p>
